    Updates the consistency of lineage information across a list of DataFrames representing cell tracking over time.

    This function propagates fixed lineage information (such as generation number, root ID, parent ID, and sister IDs)
    from a reference frame or DataFrame to all relevant cells in all frames, ensuring consistency in the lineage tree.
    It can also update the lineage information for the children of fixed cells. If families are provided, it will update them as well.

    There are several ways to call this function:
    1. If `fixed_frame_i` is provided (and `fixed_df` is not), the fixed DataFrame is taken from `df_li[fixed_frame_i]`.
    2. If `fixed_df` is provided (and `fixed_frame_i` is not), the fixed frame index is inferred from `fixed_df`.
    3. If `Cell_IDs_fixed` is provided, only those Cell IDs are considered for consistency updates; otherwise, all IDs in the fixed DataFrame are used.

    Parameters:
    - df_li (list of pd.DataFrame): List of DataFrames, one per frame, each indexed by Cell_ID.
    - fixed_frame_i (int, optional): Index of the frame to use as the reference for fixed lineage information.
    - fixed_df (pd.DataFrame, optional): DataFrame containing fixed lineage information for selected cells.
    - Cell_IDs_fixed (iterable, optional): Iterable of Cell IDs to consider for consistency updates. If None, all IDs in `fixed_df` are used.
    - consider_children (bool, default=True): If True, also updates the lineage information for children of fixed cells.
    - families (list, optional): List of families to update along the way. If None, it is not used.

    Returns:
    - list of pd.DataFrame: The updated list of DataFrames with consistent lineage information.

    Notes:
    - The columns updated for consistency are: 'generation_num_tree', 'root_ID_tree', 'sister_ID_tree', 'parent_ID_tree'.
    - The function maintains a lookup dictionary and a list of fixed DataFrames to efficiently propagate updates.
