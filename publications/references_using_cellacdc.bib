abstract = {AbstractMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is present in multiple copies within cells and is required for mitochondrial ATP generation. Even within individual cells, mtDNA copies can differ in their sequence, a state known as heteroplasmy. The principles underlying dynamic changes in the degree of heteroplasmy remain incompletely understood, due to the inability to monitor this phenomenon in real time. Here, we employ mtDNA-based fluorescent markers, microfluidics, and automated cell tracking, to follow mtDNA variants in live heteroplasmic yeast populations at the single-cell level. This approach, in combination with direct mtDNA tracking and data-driven mathematical modeling reveals asymmetric partitioning of mtDNA copies during cell division, as well as limited mitochondrial fusion and fission frequencies, as critical driving forces for mtDNA variant segregation. Given that our approach also facilitates assessment of segregation between intact and mutant mtDNA, we anticipate that it will be instrumental in elucidating the mechanisms underlying the purifying selection of mtDNA.},

abstract = {AbstractTo maintain protein homeostasis in changing nutrient environments, cells must precisely control the amount of their proteins, despite the accompanying changes in cell growth and biosynthetic capacity. As nutrients are major regulators of cell cycle length and progression, a particular challenge arises for the nutrient-dependent regulation of ‘cell cycle genes’, which are periodically expressed during the cell cycle. One important example are histones, which are needed at a constant histone-to-DNA stoichiometry. Here we show that budding yeast achieves histone homeostasis in different nutrients through a decoupling of transcript and protein abundance. We find that cells downregulate histone transcripts in poor nutrients to avoid toxic histone overexpression, but produce constant amounts of histone proteins through nutrient-specific regulation of translation efficiency. Our findings suggest that this allows cells to balance the need for rapid histone production under fast growth conditions with the tight regulation required to avoid toxic overexpression in poor nutrients.},

Fasting is a major environmental cue across the animal kingdom, yet how it impacts three-dimensional (3D) genome organization is unknown. Here we show that fasting induces an intestine-specific, reversible and large-scale spatial reorganization of chromatin in Caenorhabditis elegans. This fasting-induced 3D genome reorganization requires inhibition of the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway, acting through the regulation of RNA Pol I, but not Pol II nor Pol III, and is accompanied by remodelling of the nucleolus. By uncoupling the 3D genome configuration from the animal’s nutritional status, we find that the expression of metabolic and stress-related genes increases when the spatial reorganization of chromatin occurs, showing that the 3D genome might support the transcriptional response in fasted animals. Our work documents a large-scale chromatin reorganization triggered by fasting and reveals that mTOR and RNA Pol I shape genome architecture in response to nutrients.},

Increasing cell size was recently shown to remodel the proteomes of cultured human cells, demonstrating that large and small cells of the same type can be compositionally different. In the present study, we utilize the natural heterogeneity of hepatocyte ploidy and yeast genetics to establish that the ploidy-to-cell size ratio is a highly conserved determinant of proteome composition. In both mammalian and yeast cells, genome dilution by cell growth elicits a starvation-like phenotype, suggesting that growth in large cells is restricted by genome concentration in a manner that mimics a limiting nutrient. Moreover, genome dilution explains some proteomic changes ascribed to yeast aging. Overall, our data indicate that genome concentration drives changes in cell composition independently of external environmental cues.},

	abstract = {To maintain stable DNA concentrations, proliferating cells need to coordinate DNA replication with cell growth. For nuclear DNA, eukaryotic cells achieve this by coupling DNA replication to cell-cycle progression, ensuring that DNA is doubled exactly once per cell cycle. By contrast, mitochondrial DNA replication is typically not strictly coupled to the cell cycle, leaving the open question of how cells maintain the correct amount of mitochondrial DNA during cell growth. Here, we show that in budding yeast, mitochondrial DNA copy number increases with cell volume, both in asynchronously cycling populations and during G1 arrest. Our findings suggest that cell-volume-dependent mitochondrial DNA maintenance is achieved through nuclear-encoded limiting factors, including the mitochondrial DNA polymerase Mip1 and the packaging factor Abf2, whose amount increases in proportion to cell volume. By directly linking mitochondrial DNA maintenance to nuclear protein synthesis and thus cell growth, constant mitochondrial DNA concentrations can be robustly maintained without a need for cell-cycle-dependent regulation.},

Single-cell analysis techniques have emerged as ideal tools to gauge the complexity of cellular responses in these models. However, the single-cell quantitative assessment based on 3D-microscopic data of the subcellular distribution of fluorescence markers, such as the nuclear/cytoplasm ratio of transcription factors, has largely remained elusive. For spheroid generation, ultra-low attachment plates are noteworthy due to their simplicity, compatibility with automation, and experimental and commercial accessibility. However, it is unknown whether and to what degree the plate type impacts spheroid formation and biology. This study developed a novel AI-based pipeline for the analysis of 3D-confocal data of optically cleared large spheroids at the wholemount, single-cell, and sub-cellular levels. To identify relevant samples for the pipeline, automated brightfield microscopy was employed to systematically compare the size and eccentricity of spheroids formed in six different plate types using four distinct human cell lines. This showed that all plate types exhibited similar spheroid-forming capabilities and the gross patterns of growth or shrinkage during 4 days after seeding were comparable. Yet, size and eccentricity varied systematically among specific cell lines and plate types. Based on this prescreen, spheroids of HaCaT keratinocytes and HT-29 cancer cells were further assessed. In HaCaT spheroids, the in-depth analysis revealed a correlation between spheroid size, cell proliferation, and the nuclear/cytoplasm ratio of the transcriptional coactivator, YAP1, as well as an inverse correlation with respect to cell differentiation. These findings, yielded with a spheroid model and at a single-cell level, corroborate earlier concepts of the role of YAP1 in cell proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes in human skin. Further, the results show that the plate type may influence the outcome of experimental campaigns and that it is advisable to scan different plate types for the optimal configuration during a specific investigation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Cell size is tightly controlled to optimize cell function and varies broadly depending on the organism, cell type, and environment. The budding yeast S. cerevisiae has been successfully used as a model to gain insights into eukaryotic cell size control. Multiple regulators of cell size in steady-state conditions have been identified, such as the G1/S transition activators Cln3 and Bck2 and the inhibitor Whi5. Individual deletions of these regulators result in populations with altered mean cell volumes. However, size homeostasis remains largely intact. Here, we show that although the roles of Bck2 and Cln3 for cell size regulation appear largely redundant in steady-state, a switch from fermentable to non-fermentable growth media reveals a unique role for Bck2 in cell size adaptation to changing nutrients. We use live-cell microscopy and machine learning-assisted image analysis to track single cells and their progeny through the nutrient switch. We find that after the switch, bck2Δ cells experience longer cell cycle arrests and more arrest-associated enlargement than wild-type, whi5Δ or cln3Δ cells, indicating that Bck2 becomes the critical G1/S activator in changing nutrients. Our work demonstrates that studying size regulation during nutrient shifts to mimic the dynamic environments of free-growing microorganisms can resolve apparent redundancies observed in steady-state size regulation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The size of organelles and cellular structures needs to be tightly controlled and adjusted to the overall cell size to ensure cell function. A prominent example of a self-assembly process forming a structure whose size scales with cell size is Cdc42-driven cell polarization and subsequent septin ring formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms that determine Cdc42 cluster and septin ring size are still unclear. Combining computational modeling, live-cell imaging and genetic manipulations, we show here that positive feedback in the polarization pathway, together with the amount of polarity proteins increasing with cell size, can account for the increase of the Cdc42 cluster area with cell size, and as a consequence also the scaling of the septin ring diameter. We demonstrate that in bni1Δ cells, which have a larger septin ring compared to wild-type cells but a similarly sized Cdc42-GTP cluster, disruption of F-actin cable assembly and polarization toward the bud site results in diffuse exocytosis, causing septin ring enlargement. Furthermore, we find that in cells with impaired negative feedback in the polarization pathway, the Cdc42-GTP cluster area expands compared to wild-type cells, while the septin ring diameter remains mostly unchanged. This decoupling can be partially explained by a high recruitment rate of septin via polarity factors. Taken together, we provide insights into the origin of septin ring size control, in particular the scaling with cell volume, by integrating new experimental findings and mechanistic models of budding yeast polarization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
